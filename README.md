Robot Framework excericise
"Using the web calculator found at https://web2.0calc.com/ write a Robot Framework test suite that is able to perform a simple mathematical operation with 2 operands (for example “10 + 5”). The Robot Framework test suite should type the numbers in the calculator, press the equal sign, fetch the result displayed by the web calculator and verify that this is correct. Try to implement a solution that is re-usable (using other numbers and operations), easy to maintain and easy to understand.
Operands are not limited to single digit (we should be able to calculate “100 – 20” expressions).
Addition  1+5
Subtraction 20-7
Multiplication 3*5
Division 14/2
